test.py is main code. Copy paste and save that as a file into your code runner.
Download the rest of the files and move them into the same folder/area as your code file.
Then you should be able to run it! I know you downloaded a bootleg version, so hopefully
it recognizes tkinter. If not, then you'll need to download the real python ðŸ˜µ.

PS: since this is my first attempt, I was unable to make it close once you run out of lives.
Just stop the application and re-run it if you need to ðŸ¤­.
